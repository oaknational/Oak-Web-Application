# Testing Improvement Phase 1.1 Input Plan

**Source**: Phase 1.0 Inventory Results  
**Purpose**: Prioritized guidance for Phase 1.1 deep audit  
**Date**: July 3, 2025

## Phase 1.1 Scope Definition

Based on Phase 1.0 inventory findings, Phase 1.1 should focus on **exhaustive quality assessment and deep analysis** of Oak's testing practices. This will be a comprehensive, systematic analysis of every file in priority directories, using concrete quality criteria.

## Success Factor Improvements

### 1. Exhaustive Coverage Approach

- **Read every single file** in priority directories (no sampling)
- **Systematic analysis** using the AI agent as the "automation"
- **Complete pattern documentation** across all files

### 2. Concrete Quality Rubric

- **Objective scoring system** (1-10 scale) with specific criteria
- **Measurable assessment** removing subjective evaluation
- **Actionable improvement targets** for each score component

### 3. Directory-Based Organization

- **Use natural directory boundaries** as analysis units
- **Sequential directory completion** building methodology refinement
- **Pattern validation** across similar directory structures

### 4. Representative Examples

- **Before/after code examples** for common improvement patterns
- **Concrete refactoring guides** for typical issues found
- **Effort and impact estimates** for each recommendation type

## Specific Investigation Framework

### 1. Test Quality Assessment Criteria

For each priority package, evaluate:

#### Behavior vs Implementation Testing

- [ ] Do tests assert on user-observable behavior?
- [ ] Are tests coupled to implementation details?
- [ ] Do test descriptions focus on "what" not "how"?

#### Accessibility-First Testing

- [ ] Primary use of `getByRole` queries?
- [ ] Semantic HTML testing approach?
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility verification?

#### Pure Function Extraction

- [ ] Business logic extracted from components?
- [ ] Testable functions separated from side effects?
- [ ] Domain logic in pure, testable form?

#### TDD Evidence

- [ ] Test structure suggests test-first development?
- [ ] Comprehensive edge case coverage?
- [ ] Tests drive component API design?

### 2. Coverage Gap Analysis

#### Systematic Gap Identification

For each priority package:

1. **Component Coverage**: Which components lack tests?
2. **Function Coverage**: Which exported functions lack tests?
3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Which error conditions lack tests?
4. **Integration Coverage**: Which component interactions lack tests?

#### Gap Prioritization Criteria

- **Business Impact**: User-facing features first
- **Complexity**: Complex logic requires testing
- **Change Frequency**: Active development areas
- **Risk Level**: Error-prone functionality

### 3. Mock Pattern Consistency

#### Mock Factory Assessment

- [ ] Consistent mock creation patterns?
- [ ] Reusable mock factories available?
- [ ] Type-safe mock implementations?
- [ ] Oak domain modeling in mocks?

#### Mock Strategy Evaluation

- [ ] Minimal mocking approach used?
- [ ] External dependencies properly mocked?
- [ ] Mock complexity appropriate for test scope?

## Investigation Methods

### Directory-by-Directory Exhaustive Audit

#### Step 1: Complete Directory Analysis

- **Read every single file** in the target directory
- **Apply quality rubric** systematically to each file
- **Document all patterns** found (good and concerning)
- **Record coverage gaps** at file level

#### Step 2: Pattern Synthesis

- **Identify recurring patterns** across all files in directory
- **Categorize findings** by pattern type and frequency
- **Select representative examples** for each pattern
- **Calculate directory quality score** from individual file scores

#### Step 3: Methodology Refinement

- **Refine quality rubric** based on findings
- **Improve analysis approach** for next directory
- **Document lessons learned** for methodology improvement
- **Prepare concrete recommendations** with examples

## Test Quality Rubric (1-10 Scale)

For each test file, score based on the following criteria:

### Accessibility-First Testing (2 points)

- **2 points**: Primarily uses `getByRole` queries, semantic HTML testing
- **1 point**: Mixed query usage, some `getByRole` but also `getByTestId`
- **0 points**: Predominantly uses `getByTestId` or implementation details

### Behavior vs Implementation Testing (2 points)

- **2 points**: Tests focus on user-observable behavior and outcomes
- **1 point**: Mix of behavior and implementation testing
- **0 points**: Tests primarily assert on implementation details

### Pure Function Extraction (2 points)

- **2 points**: Business logic extracted to pure, testable functions
- **1 point**: Some logic extraction, but mixed with side effects
- **0 points**: Logic embedded in components, difficult to test in isolation

### Oak Domain Modeling (2 points)

- **2 points**: Mocks and test data use realistic Oak curriculum concepts
- **1 point**: Some domain modeling, but inconsistent or generic
- **0 points**: Generic test data, no domain-specific modeling

### Test Quality and Coverage (2 points)

- **2 points**: Comprehensive edge cases, error conditions, and user scenarios
- **1 point**: Good coverage of happy path, some edge cases
- **0 points**: Minimal coverage, missing edge cases and error conditions

### Quality Score Interpretation

- **9-10**: Excellent - Model for other tests
- **7-8**: Good - Minor improvements needed
- **5-6**: Adequate - Significant improvement opportunities
- **3-4**: Poor - Major refactoring needed
- **1-2**: Critical - Complete rewrite recommended
