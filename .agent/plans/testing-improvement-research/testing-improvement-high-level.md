# Testing Improvement Plan

This document tracks planned improvements to Oak's automated testing approach and implementation.

## Current State

- Comprehensive testing documentation in `docs/testing-strategy/`
- Enhanced 6-category test quality rubric with performance standards
- 633 test files analyzed with context-aware scoring (Phase 1.1 complete)
- Strong foundations: Utilities (7.8/10), APIs (6.8/10)
- Critical gap: Components (5.2/10) - largest category
- Untested critical endpoint: curriculum-downloads
- Mixed TDD adoption, strong React Testing Library usage
- Jest as primary test runner

## Planned Improvements

### Phase 1: Foundation

#### 1.0: Prepare âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] Review test code across the codebase. This will be shallow and broad, to enable in-depth analysis in the next phase.
- [x] Record the audit findings in a report

#### 1.1: Understand âœ… COMPLETED (July 7, 2025)

Applied enhanced 6-category rubric with performance standards to ALL 633 test files.

- [x] Context-aware scoring methodology applied
- [x] All 633 test files systematically assessed
- [x] Critical gaps identified: Component accessibility (12%), untested curriculum-downloads endpoint
- [x] Performance monitoring gaps documented across all layers
- [x] Comprehensive report created with implementation examples

#### 1.2: Identify âœ… COMPLETED (July 9, 2025)

**Context**: [Phase 1.1 report](testing-improvement-phase-1-1-report.md) complete with context-aware insights. [Phase 1.2 report](testing-improvement-phase-1-2-report.md) documents all findings.

**Key Findings**:

1. **641 test files** (not 633) with quality issues
2. **100% API coverage** but varying test quality
3. **22 custom hooks** completely untested
4. **Top 20 components** need behavior-focused refactoring

Using the Phase 1.1 findings, created actionable implementation tasks:

- [x] Identified violations of "test behaviour, not implementation"
  - Found: Component tests checking styles/state instead of behavior
  - Documented in: `outputs/test-organization-audit.md`
- [x] Identified opportunities for pure function extraction
  - [x] 10+ extraction candidates prioritized by impact
  - [x] Quiz, video, school validation as Priority 1
  - [x] Documented in: `outputs/pure-function-opportunities.md`
- [x] Identified inconsistent mock patterns
  - Created: `outputs/mock-factory-patterns.md` comprehensive guide
- [x] Identified inconsistent test organisation
  - Enhanced analysis in: `outputs/test-organization-audit.md`
- [x] Identified React best practice adoption opportunities
  - Found: 1,400+ line components, excessive state, inline functions
  - Documented in: `outputs/react-testing-best-practices.md`
- [x] Identified Next.js best practice adoption opportunities
  - Found: Fat controllers, missing error boundaries
  - Documented in: `outputs/nextjs-testing-best-practices.md`
- [x] Identified components lacking accessibility-first testing
  - No systematic a11y testing across all components
- [x] Identified testing anti-patterns
  - Implementation detail testing, wrong abstraction levels, no performance benchmarks
- [x] Identified API route handlers missing test coverage
  - Great news: 100% API coverage! Documented in: `outputs/api-routes-test-coverage.md`
- [x] Identified custom hooks missing test coverage
  - 22 hooks untested, documented in: `outputs/custom-hooks-test-coverage.md`
- [x] Documented all findings in comprehensive reports
  - 11 detailed analysis documents in `outputs/` directory

### Phase 2: Planning

**Purpose**: Transform Phase 1 findings into actionable implementation plans (no code changes)

  - Executive summary created
- [x] Prioritize improvements by impact/effort matrix
  - 10 quick wins identified and prioritized
- [x] Create sprint-sized work packages
  - Work items batch 1 documented
- [x] Establish success metrics and quality gates
  - Quality gates defined, tracking template created

#### Phase 2.1: Quick Win Planning âœ… COMPLETED (July 2025)

**Status**: All deliverables complete, ready for Phase 3

- [x] Identify 10 pure functions for extraction pilot
  - Quiz, video, school validation functions prioritized
- [x] Select 3 high-traffic components for refactoring pilot

## Test Related Technical Debt

To be reviewed after each phase. If not resolved, additional sub-phases will be added.

### High Priority (From Phase 1.1 Analysis)

- **Component accessibility**: 327 files with 12% coverage (user interface crisis)
- **Curriculum-downloads API**: Critical untested endpoint (teacher access risk)
- **Performance monitoring**: 0% in build processes, <50% elsewhere

### Medium Priority

- Service performance monitoring (Infrastructure/APIs)
- Page load performance (69% fail <2s threshold)
- Educational domain modelling in applicable tests

### Low Priority

- Storybook tests could be expanded
- Performance benchmarks needed
- Contract testing for external APIs

## Success Metrics (Updated from Phase 1.1)

- Average quality score: 6.2/10 â†’ 8.5/10 (context-aware scoring)
- User-facing accessibility: 21% â†’ 95% (Components + Pages)
- Performance compliance: 38% â†’ 90% (context-appropriate)
- Critical endpoints: 0 â†’ 100% tested
- Component quality: 5.2/10 â†’ 8.0/10 (largest impact)
- Build monitoring: 0% â†’ 90% (deployment reliability)
- Developer confidence: Measurable improvement in deployment frequency

## Research Topics
