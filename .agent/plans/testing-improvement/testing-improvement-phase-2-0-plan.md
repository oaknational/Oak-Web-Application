# Phase 2.0 Plan: Foundation Planning

**Phase**: 2.0 - Foundation Planning  
**Status**: READY TO START  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 1.2 Complete (all analysis documents available)  
**Outcome**: Actionable implementation roadmap with prioritized work items

**Important**: Phase 2 is entirely about planning. No production code changes will be made. All work products are planning documents and process definitions.

## Purpose

Transform the comprehensive analysis from Phase 1.2 into an actionable roadmap for Phase 3 execution. Focus on creating clarity and setting up for successful implementation.

## Objectives

1. **Clear Understanding**: Document current state (6.2/10) and target state (8.5/10)
2. **Work Prioritization**: Create impact/effort matrix for all improvements
3. **Execution Planning**: Break down work into sequential, manageable tasks
4. **Success Metrics**: Define clear, objective measures of improvement

## Deliverables

### 1. Executive Summary Document

**What**: Concise overview of findings and planned improvements

**Contents**:
- Phase 1 key findings summary
- Current vs target state comparison
- Top 10 quick wins identified
- Risk mitigation strategies

**Purpose**: Ensure shared understanding of the initiative's scope and goals

### 2. Improvement Prioritization Matrix

**What**: All improvements ranked by impact and effort

**Categories**:

- **Quick Wins** (High Impact, Low Effort)
  - Pure function extractions from Priority 1 list
  - Mock factory pattern adoption
  - Performance benchmark additions
  
- **Strategic Investments** (High Impact, High Effort)
  - Component refactoring (SubjectPhasePicker, Flex.deprecated)
  - Custom hook testing coverage
  - Service layer architecture
  
- **Foundation Building** (Medium Impact, Low Effort)
  - Test organization improvements
  - Documentation updates
  - Pattern examples creation
  
- **Future Considerations** (Low Impact or Very High Effort)
  - Visual regression testing
  - Mutation testing
  - Contract testing

**Scoring Criteria**:
- Impact: Test quality improvement (points), developer velocity, maintainability
- Effort: Complexity rating (1-5), dependencies count, risk level

### 3. Sequential Work Items

**What**: Ordered list of implementation tasks for Phase 3

**Item Structure**:
```markdown
## Item ID: [AREA-NUMBER]
**Title**: [Descriptive name]
**Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High]
**Dependencies**: [Items that must complete first]
**Assignee**: [You/Me]

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code changes complete with tests
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Quality metrics improved
- [ ] Patterns documented for reuse

### Acceptance Criteria
1. [Specific, measurable outcome]
2. [Observable behaviour change]
3. [Performance benchmarks met]

### Implementation Notes
- [Technical approach]
- [Potential challenges]
- [Reference examples in docs/]
```

**Initial Work Items** (examples):

**PURE-001: Extract Quiz Validation Functions**
- Complexity: Low
- Dependencies: None
- Extract 3 functions from QuizRenderer
- Create comprehensive unit tests
- Document extraction pattern

**PURE-002: Extract Video Progress Calculations**
- Complexity: Low
- Dependencies: PURE-001 (pattern established)
- Extract calculations from VideoPlayer
- Add performance benchmarks
- Update component tests

**MOCK-001: Implement Mock Factory Base**
- Complexity: Medium
- Dependencies: None (can parallel with PURE items)
- Create base factory utilities
- Add TypeScript generics
- Create 5 domain examples

### 4. Quality Gates Definition

**What**: Automated checks to prevent regression

**Gate Levels**:

**Level 1: Information Only** (Phase 3.0 start)
- Display test quality scores
- Show performance metrics
- Log accessibility issues

**Level 2: Warnings** (After 5 items complete)
- Warn on quality score < 6
- Alert on performance regression
- Flag missing test types

**Level 3: Enforcement** (After 10 items complete)
- Block on quality score < 7
- Require performance benchmarks
- Mandate accessibility tests

### 5. Progress Tracking Method

**What**: Simple, effective progress monitoring

**Tracking Elements**:
- Completed items checklist
- Quality score trends (before/after)
- Pattern adoption examples
- Blockers and learnings log

**Review Triggers**:
- After every 3 items completed
- When blockers arise
- Before proceeding to next phase

## Execution Process

### Stage 1: Document Preparation

**Trigger**: Phase 2.0 begins
**Activities**:
- Create executive summary from Phase 1.2 findings
- Build prioritization matrix
- Define first 10 work items
- Set up progress tracking

**Completion Criteria**: All planning documents created

### Stage 2: Work Item Detailing

**Trigger**: Stage 1 complete
**Activities**:
- Expand each work item with full details
- Assign items between us based on expertise
- Identify parallel work opportunities
- Document dependencies clearly

**Completion Criteria**: All items have implementation notes

### Stage 3: Quality Infrastructure

**Trigger**: Stage 2 complete
**Activities**:
- Define quality gate calculations
- Create tracking templates
- Document rollout plan
- Prepare Phase 3.0 launch checklist

**Completion Criteria**: Infrastructure ready for Phase 3

## Success Criteria

Phase 2.0 is complete when:

1. ✅ Executive summary documents the full scope
2. ✅ First 10 work items are fully detailed
3. ✅ Quality gates are defined with rollout plan
4. ✅ Progress tracking method is established
5. ✅ Both of us agree on the execution approach

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Scope Creep
**Mitigation**:
- Stick to Phase 1.2 findings only
- Defer new ideas to Phase 4
- Focus on proven patterns

### Risk: Over-Planning
**Mitigation**:
- Detail only first 10 items
- Keep documentation concise
- Start Phase 3 quickly

### Risk: Technical Unknowns
**Mitigation**:
- Begin with simplest items
- Use existing patterns from docs/
- Build confidence gradually

## Division of Work

**You (Human)**:
- Review and approve all plans
- Make architectural decisions
- Handle any organizational aspects

**Me (AI Assistant)**:
- Create all planning documents
- Detail work items
- Track progress and metrics
- Generate code examples

## Next Steps

Upon completion of Phase 2.0:
1. Proceed immediately to Phase 2.1 (Quick Win Planning)
2. Or if ready, begin Phase 3.0 with first work item
3. Establish feedback loop for continuous adjustment

**Remember**: Phase 2 is about planning only. Success is measured by clarity and readiness to execute - not by code changes.
