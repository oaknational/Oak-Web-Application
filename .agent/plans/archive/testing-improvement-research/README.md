## Current Status (July 10, 2025)

**Active Phase**: 2.2 - Architecture Planning  
**Completed**: Phases 1.0-1.2 (Analysis), 2.0-2.1 (Foundation & Quick Win Planning)

## Key Documents

### Main Tracking
- **[testing-improvement-high-level.md](testing-improvement-high-level.md)** - Overall initiative tracking and status

### Active Planning Documents
- **[testing-improvement-phase-2-0-plan.md](testing-improvement-phase-2-0-plan.md)** - Foundation planning (COMPLETED)
- **[testing-improvement-phase-2-1-plan.md](testing-improvement-phase-2-1-plan.md)** - Quick win planning (COMPLETED)
- **[phase-2-1-completion.md](phase-2-1-completion.md)** - Phase 2.1 completion summary with deliverables
- **[risk-mitigation-matrix.md](risk-mitigation-matrix.md)** - Active risk management
- **[learning-optimization-plan.md](learning-optimization-plan.md)** - Knowledge transfer strategy

### Phase Outputs
- **[outputs/phase-1/](outputs/phase-1/)** - Test coverage analysis, improvement opportunities
- **[outputs/phase-2/](outputs/phase-2/)** - Executive summary, prioritization matrix, work items

## Navigation Guide

1. **New to the project?** Start with:
   - [Executive Summary](outputs/phase-2/01-executive-summary.md)
   - [High-Level Plan](testing-improvement-high-level.md)

2. **Looking for current work?** Check:
   - [Phase 2.1 Completion](phase-2-1-completion.md) for latest deliverables
   - [Work Items Batch 1](outputs/phase-2/03-work-items-batch-1.md) for implementation tasks

3. **Planning next steps?** Review:
   - [Prioritization Matrix](outputs/phase-2/02-improvement-prioritization-matrix.md)
   - [Risk Mitigation](risk-mitigation-matrix.md)

## Quick Links to Key Findings

- **641 test files** analyzed with context-aware scoring
- **6.2/10** current average quality → **8.5/10** target
- **22 custom hooks** with zero tests identified
- **10+ pure functions** ready for extraction
- **100% API coverage** but varying test quality

## Next Actions

1. **Phase 2.2**: Create architecture planning documents
2. **Phase 2.3**: Develop team enablement materials
3. **Phase 3.0**: Begin pilot implementation (after planning complete)
