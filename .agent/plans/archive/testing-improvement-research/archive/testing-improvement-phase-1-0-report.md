```

### Source Directory Structure

```

## Test File Inventory

### Test File Distribution

- **Total Test Files**: 660
- **TypeScript Tests (.ts)**: 257 files
- **React Tests (.tsx)**: 373 files  
- **JavaScript Tests (.js)**: 2 files
- **Snapshot Files (.snap)**: 27 files
- **Configuration Tests (.json)**: 1 file

### Test File Organization Patterns

#### 1. Colocation Pattern (Majority)

Tests live next to source files:

```text
components/AppComponents/AppHeader/
├── AppHeader.tsx
├── AppHeader.test.tsx
├── AppHeader.stories.tsx
└── index.ts
```

#### 2. Dedicated Test Directory (Pages)

Due to Next.js constraints:

```text
src/__tests__/pages/
├── 404.test.tsx
├── _app.test.tsx
├── index.test.tsx
└── teachers/
    ├── index.test.tsx
    └── search.test.tsx
```

#### 3. Mixed Organization

- Components: Consistently colocated
- Pages: Dedicated test directory
- Utilities: Colocated
- Hooks: Colocated
- API routes: Mix of patterns

### Test Directory Locations

```text
./src/__tests__/           # Main dedicated test directory
./test/                    # Root-level test directory (minimal usage)
./scripts/dev/test/        # Development testing utilities
```

## Source File Analysis

### Files Requiring Tests

#### React Components

- **Total Components**: 615 .tsx files
- **Location**: Organized by domain (App, Curriculum, Pupil, Teacher, Shared)
- **Test Status**: High coverage observed - most components have associated tests

#### Custom Hooks

- **Total Hooks**: 66 files (using useXxx naming convention)
- **Primary Location**: `src/hooks/` (17 files) + distributed across components
- **Test Coverage**: Good - most hooks have dedicated tests

#### API Routes

- **Pages API**: 13 files in `src/pages/api/`
- **App API**: 2 files in `src/app/api/`
- **Total API Endpoints**: 15 files
- **Test Coverage**: Partial - some routes have tests, others don't

#### Utility Functions

- **Utils Directory**: 59 files in `src/utils/`
- **Test Coverage**: High - most utilities have associated tests
- **Organization**: Domain-specific subdirectories (curriculum/, slugModifiers/, etc.)

#### Context Providers

- **Total Providers**: 6 main context providers
- **Test Coverage**: Excellent - all providers have comprehensive tests

## Testing Infrastructure

### Configuration Files

- **jest.config.js**: Main Jest configuration
- **jest.base.config.js**: Base configuration
- **jest.components.config.js**: Component-specific config
- **jest.pages.config.js**: Pages-specific config
- **jest.setup.js**: Test setup and global mocks
- **jest.storybook.config.js**: Storybook testing config

### Package Scripts

```json
{
  "test": "jest --watch --collectCoverage=false",
  "test:coverage": "jest --watch --collectCoverage=true",
  "test:ci": "jest --watchAll=false --coverage"
}
```

### Testing Dependencies Analysis

**Primary Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library
**Additional Tools**:

- Storybook for component testing
- Percy for visual regression testing  
- Pa11y for accessibility testing

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Workflows**:

- `code_checks.yml` - Runs tests on pull requests
- Test execution integrated into deployment pipeline
- Automated testing on push events

### Test Utilities and Helpers

**Location**: `src/__tests__/__helpers__/`
**Key Utilities**:

- Mock providers (Analytics, Clerk, etc.)
- Test rendering utilities
- Fake fetch implementations
- Mock data generators

## Code Organization Patterns

### Component Organization

**Domain-Driven Structure**:

```text
components/
├── AppComponents/         # Application shell
├── CurriculumComponents/  # Curriculum-specific features  
├── GenericPagesComponents/# Reusable page components
├── PupilComponents/       # Pupil-facing features
├── SharedComponents/      # Cross-domain reusable components
└── TeacherComponents/     # Teacher-specific features
```

### Testing Organization Consistency

#### ✅ Consistent Patterns

- Component tests consistently colocated
- Test file naming follows `*.test.tsx` pattern
- Story files follow `*.stories.tsx` pattern
- Mock files organized in dedicated `__mocks__` directories

#### ⚠️ Inconsistent Patterns  

- API route tests: Mix of colocated and separate directories
- Page tests: Required separation due to Next.js constraints
- Utility tests: Some colocated, some in separate test directories
- Snapshot tests: Mixed naming conventions

### Import Patterns

- **Relative imports**: Predominantly used within feature domains
- **Absolute imports**: Used for shared utilities and components
- **Index files**: Consistent use for clean import interfaces

## Coverage Gaps Identified

### Components Without Tests

- Most components appear to have tests, but comprehensive audit needed
- Focus areas: Recently added components, complex interactive components

### API Routes Without Tests

- Several API routes lack comprehensive test coverage
- Authentication routes in `src/app/api/` need testing attention

### Utilities Without Tests

- Minority of utility functions lack tests
- Focus needed on newer utility functions

### Integration Gaps

- Limited end-to-end testing beyond visual regression
- API integration testing could be enhanced
- Cross-domain component interaction testing

## Testing Tool Usage

### Jest Configuration Analysis

- **Multiple Jest configs** suggest different testing strategies for different parts of the codebase
- **Sophisticated setup** with component-specific and page-specific configurations
- **Coverage reporting** integrated but thresholds not immediately visible

### React Testing Library Usage

- **Accessibility-first approach** evident from component test patterns
- **User-centric testing** approach consistently applied
- **Custom render utilities** suggest mature testing practices

### Storybook Integration

- **Component isolation testing** via Storybook
- **Visual testing** capabilities available
- **Accessibility testing** integrated with a11y addon

## Team Practices Indicators

### Positive Indicators

- **High test file count** indicates strong testing culture
- **Consistent file naming** shows team alignment on conventions
- **Comprehensive mock infrastructure** suggests mature testing practices
- **Domain-driven organization** reflects thoughtful architecture

### Areas for Improvement

- **Mixed organization patterns** suggest evolution over time without consolidation
- **Test configuration complexity** may create barriers to contribution
- **Coverage gap variations** across different code domains

## Recommendations for Phase 1.1

### High Priority Packages for Deep Audit

1. **`src/components/CurriculumComponents/`** - Largest component section, core business logic
2. **`src/components/PupilComponents/`** - User-facing features, complex interactions
3. **`src/pages/api/`** - API endpoint testing coverage
4. **`src/utils/curriculum/`** - Core business logic utilities
5. **`src/hooks/`** - Custom hook testing patterns

### Specific Investigation Areas

1. **Test Quality Assessment**: Review test patterns for behavior vs implementation testing
2. **Coverage Analysis**: Identify specific components/functions lacking tests
3. **Mock Pattern Consistency**: Analyze mock factory usage across domains
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Evaluate RTL query hierarchy usage
5. **Integration Testing**: Assess cross-component testing coverage

### Resource Requirements for Phase 1.1

- **Estimated Time**: 40-60 hours for comprehensive audit
- **Focus Areas**: 5 priority packages identified above
- **Tools Needed**: Coverage analysis tools, test quality assessment framework
- **Expertise Required**: React Testing Library, Jest, Oak domain knowledge

## Technical Debt Observations

### Configuration Complexity

- Multiple Jest configurations may create maintenance overhead
- Consider consolidation opportunities while maintaining functionality

### Test Organization Evolution  

- Evidence of organic growth in testing practices
- Opportunity for standardization without losing existing coverage

### Documentation Integration

- Testing strategy documentation exists in `docs/testing-strategy/`
- AI agent guidance available in `.agent/rules/testing-strategy.md`
- Integration between documentation and actual practices needs verification
