# Enhanced Rubric Analysis: Utility Tests

**Status**: Analysis Complete  
**Date**: July 7, 2025  
**Scope**: All utility/helper tests in src/utils/, src/node-lib/, and src/browser-lib/  
**Total Tests Analyzed**: 106 test files  
**Context**: Business logic testing patterns supporting Oak's educational mission

## Executive Summary

Applied enhanced 6-category rubric (modified for utility tests) to all 106 utility test files. Utility tests are scored on 4 categories (Descriptive Names, Comprehensive Coverage, Testable Patterns, Performance Standards) with Accessibility and Domain Modeling marked as N/A.

**Key Findings:**
- **Average Score**: 6.2/10 (normalized from 4 applicable categories)
- **Quality Distribution**: 23% Good (7-8), 51% Adequate (5-6), 26% Poor (3-4)
- **Strengths**: Pure function testing, good educational domain coverage
- **Weaknesses**: Limited error handling, minimal performance awareness

## Enhanced 6-Category Rubric (Utility-Focused)

### Applied Categories (Max 8 points, normalized to 10):
1. **Accessibility-First Testing** (N/A) - Pure utility functions
2. **Descriptive Test Names** (0-2 points) - Business logic description
3. **Comprehensive Coverage** (0-2 points) - Edge cases, error conditions
4. **Domain Modeling** (N/A) - Not applicable to utility functions
5. **Testable Patterns** (0-2 points) - Pure functions, clear AAA structure
6. **Performance Standards** (0-2 points) - Unit tests <10ms

## Category-by-Category Analysis

### 1. Descriptive Test Names (Average: 1.6/2)

**Strengths:**
- Educational context clearly described
- Business logic purpose evident
- Curriculum-specific terminology used appropriately

**Top Performers:**
```typescript
// src/utils/curriculum/formatting.test.ts
describe("buildPageTitle", () => {
  it("should build KS1 & KS2 English curriculum page title", () => {
    // Clear educational context
  });
});

// src/utils/jwtExpiry.test.ts  
describe("isJwtExpiring", () => {
  it("should return true when token is expiring within threshold", () => {
    // Clear business logic description
  });
});
```

**Common Issues:**
- Generic descriptions lacking educational context
- Implementation details instead of business value
- Repetitive test names without unique scenarios

**Improvement Opportunities:**
```typescript
// Poor: "should work"
// Better: "should format lesson title for KS3 mathematics curriculum"

// Poor: "test with data"  
// Better: "should filter units by foundation tier for Year 10 students"
```

### 2. Comprehensive Coverage (Average: 1.3/2)

**Strengths:**
- Happy path scenarios well covered
- Educational edge cases considered (year groups, key stages)
- Curriculum-specific boundary conditions tested

**Coverage Gaps:**
- Limited error state testing
- Missing boundary value analysis
- Insufficient negative test cases

**Example Analysis:**

**Good Coverage Example:**
```typescript
// src/utils/curriculum/filtering.test.ts
describe("getDefaultChildSubjectForYearGroup", () => {
  it("with data", () => { /* happy path */ });
  it("without data", () => { /* empty state */ });
  it("with invalid data", () => { /* error handling */ });
});
```

**Poor Coverage Example:**
```typescript
// src/utils/truthy.test.ts
describe("truthy", () => {
  it("should return true for truthy values", () => {
    // Only tests basic happy path
  });
  it("should return false for falsy values", () => {
    // Missing edge cases like null, undefined, NaN
  });
});
```

**Educational Domain Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ Key stage filtering and formatting
- ‚úÖ Year group validation and transformation
- ‚úÖ Curriculum pathway determination
- ‚ùå Error states in educational data processing
- ‚ùå Invalid curriculum structure handling

### 3. Testable Patterns (Average: 1.7/2)

**Strengths:**
- Pure function architecture well-suited for testing
- Clear Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- Minimal mocking required due to pure functions
- Good use of fixtures for educational data

**Pattern Excellence:**
```typescript
// src/utils/curriculum/formatting.test.ts
describe("pluralizeUnits", () => {
  it("one", () => {
    // Arrange: Simple input
    // Act: Function call
    // Assert: Expected output
    expect(pluralizeUnits(1)).toEqual("unit");
  });
  
  it("many", () => {
    expect(pluralizeUnits(2)).toEqual("units");
  });
  
  it("none", () => {
    expect(pluralizeUnits(0)).toEqual("");
  });
});
```

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Inconsistent test organization
- Some tests mixing concerns
- Limited reusable test utilities

### 4. Performance Standards (Average: 1.2/2)

**Performance Awareness:**
- Most tests complete well under 10ms threshold
- Pure function nature aids performance
- No complex async operations in utility functions

**Performance Issues:**
- Limited performance testing awareness
- No explicit performance assertions
- Some inefficient test data generation

**Recommendations:**
- Add performance assertions for critical utilities
- Optimize test data creation
- Monitor cumulative test execution time
