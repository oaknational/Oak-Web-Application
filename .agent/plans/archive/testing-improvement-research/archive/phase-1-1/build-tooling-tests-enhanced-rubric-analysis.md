## Critical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

#### 1. Accessibility-First Styling System
```typescript
// Required for ALL styling utility tests
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';
expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

// Example for color utilities
describe('Color Utility Accessibility', () => {
  it('should provide sufficient contrast ratios for educational content', async () => {
    const StyledComponent = styled.div`
      ${color}
      background-color: white;
    `;
    
    render(<StyledComponent $color="text-primary">
      Educational content example
    </StyledComponent>);
    
    const results = await axe(document.body);
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
    
    // Test contrast ratio compliance
    expect(getContrastRatio('text-primary', 'white')).toBeGreaterThan(4.5);
  });
  
  it('should support high contrast mode for classroom accessibility', () => {
    const { getByTestId } = renderWithTheme(
      <StyledComponent data-testid="test" $color="text-primary" />,
      { theme: 'high-contrast' }
    );
    
    expect(getByTestId('test')).toHaveStyle('color: #000000');
  });
});
```

#### 2. Educational Domain Integration
```typescript
// Example for responsive utilities
const mockClassroomDeviceScenarios = [
  { device: 'classroom_tablet', breakpoint: 'md', orientation: 'landscape' },
  { device: 'interactive_whiteboard', breakpoint: 'xl', orientation: 'landscape' },
  { device: 'pupil_chromebook', breakpoint: 'sm', orientation: 'portrait' }
];

describe('Responsive Utilities - Classroom Scenarios', () => {
  it.each(mockClassroomDeviceScenarios)(
    'should render correctly on $device',
    ({ device, breakpoint, orientation }) => {
      const StyledComponent = styled.div`
        ${responsive('font-size', props => props.$fontSize)}
      `;
      
      render(
        <StyledComponent $fontSize={['16px', '18px', '20px']}>
          Lesson content for {device}
        </StyledComponent>,
        { viewport: getViewportForDevice(device) }
      );
      
      expect(screen.getByText(/Lesson content/)).toHaveStyle(
        `font-size: ${getFontSizeForBreakpoint(breakpoint)}`
      );
    }
  );
});
```

#### 3. Build Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Required for ALL build process tests
import { measureBuildPerformance } from '@/__tests__/__helpers__/performance';

describe('Build Performance Standards', () => {
  it('should fetch secrets within performance threshold', async () => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    
    const secrets = await getSecretNamesFromPublicConfig(mockConfig);
    
    const fetchTime = performance.now() - startTime;
    expect(fetchTime).toBeLessThan(1000); // 1s threshold for secret fetching
    expect(secrets).toHaveLength(2);
  });
  
  it('should generate responsive CSS efficiently', async () => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    
    const cssResult = responsive('margin', props => props.$margin)({
      $margin: [0, 12, 24, 36]
    });
    
    const generationTime = performance.now() - startTime;
    expect(generationTime).toBeLessThan(10); // 10ms for CSS generation
    expect(cssResult).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

## Conclusion

Build and tooling tests represent Oak's weakest testing category, with critical gaps in accessibility testing for the design system and missing performance monitoring for build processes. This directly impacts educational delivery and classroom technology integration.

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Accessibility-First Design System**: All styling utilities must support educational accessibility needs
2. **Build Performance**: Build processes must be optimized for rapid educational content delivery
3. **Educational Context**: Tooling must reflect real classroom technology constraints
4. **Reliability**: Build infrastructure must support consistent educational platform delivery

**Impact on Oak's Mission:**
- Design system accessibility failures prevent inclusive education
- Build performance issues slow educational content delivery
- Missing educational context in tooling creates classroom technology gaps
- Poor error handling affects teacher workflow reliability

The build and tooling tests improvement plan requires immediate focus on accessibility integration and performance monitoring to ensure Oak's technical infrastructure supports effective educational delivery.
