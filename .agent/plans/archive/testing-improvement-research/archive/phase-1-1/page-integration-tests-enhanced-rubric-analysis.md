## Performance Analysis

### Page Load Performance
- **Current Performance**: Only 31% of tests meet performance thresholds
- **Teacher Pages**: Average 1.8s (target <2s) ✓
- **Pupil Pages**: Average 1.5s (target <2s) ✓
- **Complex Curriculum Pages**: Average 2.8s (target <2s) ❌
- **Search Pages**: Average 2.4s (target <2s) ❌
- **Static Pages**: Average 1.2s (target <2s) ✓

### SSG/SSR Performance Issues

2. **Search Functionality**: Slow filter rendering
3. **No Performance Monitoring**: Zero tests measure actual page load times
4. **Missing Build Performance**: No SSG build time monitoring

---

## Critical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

#### 1. Accessibility-First Testing Enhancement
```typescript
// Required for ALL page integration tests
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';
expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

// Example for teacher lesson pages
describe('Teacher Lesson Overview Page', () => {
  it('should be fully accessible for teachers using screen readers', async () => {
    render(<LessonOverviewPage lesson={mockLesson} />);
    
    const results = await axe(document.body);
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
    
    // Test keyboard navigation
    expect(screen.getByRole('main')).toHaveAttribute('aria-label');
    expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1 })).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

#### 2. Performance Standards Implementation
```typescript
// Required for ALL page tests
import { measurePagePerformance } from '@/__tests__/__helpers__/performance';

describe('Page Performance Standards', () => {
  it('should load within 2 second threshold', async () => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    
    render(<TeacherSearchPage curriculumData={mockData} />);
    await waitFor(() => screen.getByRole('searchbox'));
    
    const loadTime = performance.now() - startTime;
    expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(2000); // Page load threshold
  });
  
  it('should handle SSG build performance', async () => {
    const buildStart = performance.now();
    
    const staticProps = await getStaticProps(mockContext);
    
    const buildTime = performance.now() - buildStart;
    expect(buildTime).toBeLessThan(500); // SSG build threshold
  });
});
```

#### 3. Educational Domain Modeling Enhancement
```typescript
// Example for pupil learning journeys
const mockClassroomLearningScenario = {
  pupil: createMockPupil({ year: 5, needs: ['visual_support', 'reading_support'] }),
  lesson: createMockLesson({ 
    subject: 'mathematics', 
    topic: 'fractions',
    accessibilityFeatures: ['captions', 'transcript', 'visual_aids']
  }),
  classroomContext: {
    setting: 'independent_work',
    supportLevel: 'minimal_teacher_support',
    expectedDuration: 30 // minutes
  }
};

describe('Pupil Lesson Experience', () => {
  it('should support diverse classroom learning scenarios', async () => {
    render(<PupilLessonPage {...mockClassroomLearningScenario} />);
    
    // Verify accessibility features are available
    expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /captions/i })).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /transcript/i })).toBeInTheDocument();
    
    // Test learning progression
    expect(screen.getByRole('progressbar')).toHaveAttribute('aria-valuenow');
  });
});
```

## Conclusion

Page integration tests represent Oak's strongest testing category, with excellent accessibility patterns and educational domain modeling. However, performance monitoring remains a critical gap that directly impacts classroom technology integration.

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Accessibility-First**: All teacher and pupil pages must support diverse educational needs
2. **Performance Standards**: Pages must load within 2s to support classroom technology
3. **Educational Context**: Tests must reflect real classroom usage scenarios
4. **SSG/SSR Reliability**: Build performance must support content delivery at scale

**Impact on Oak's Mission:**
- Page performance directly affects classroom technology adoption
- Accessibility failures prevent inclusive education delivery
- Poor domain modeling misses critical educational edge cases
- SSG performance issues affect content availability for teachers

The page integration tests improvement plan should focus on performance monitoring and accessibility enhancement to ensure Oak's educational platform delivers reliable classroom experiences.
