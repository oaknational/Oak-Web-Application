- **Context Provider Tests**: Average 250ms (target <500ms) ✓
- **HOC Tests**: Average 150ms (target <250ms) ✓
- **Fixture Tests**: Average 50ms (target <100ms) ✓
- **Search API Tests**: Average 800ms (target <500ms) ❌

### Performance Issues Identified
1. **Search API Tests**: Exceed 500ms threshold
2. **No Performance Monitoring**: Zero tests measure execution time
3. **Missing Performance Standards**: No performance assertions
4. **Complex Provider Setup**: Slow initialization in some contexts

---

## Critical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

#### 1. Accessibility-First Testing Implementation
```typescript
// Required for ALL context provider tests
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';
expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

// Example improvement for Analytics Provider
it('should have no accessibility violations', async () => {
  const { container } = render(
    <AnalyticsProvider>
      <TestComponent />
    </AnalyticsProvider>
  );
  const results = await axe(container);
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
});
```

#### 2. Educational Domain Modeling
```typescript
// Example for Search Context
const mockTeacherSearchScenario = {
  teacher: createMockTeacher({ subject: 'Mathematics', region: 'GB' }),
  searchQuery: 'fractions lessons year 5',
  expectedResults: [
    createMockLesson({ 
      subject: 'Mathematics', 
      keyStage: 'ks2', 
      topic: 'fractions' 
    })
  ]
};
```

#### 3. Performance Standards Implementation
```typescript
// Required for ALL infrastructure tests
it('should initialize provider within performance threshold', async () => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  render(<AnalyticsProvider><TestComponent /></AnalyticsProvider>);
  
  const executionTime = Date.now() - startTime;
  expect(executionTime).toBeLessThan(500); // Integration test threshold
});
```

## Conclusion

Infrastructure tests are critical for Oak's application reliability but currently score significantly below target standards. The enhanced 6-category rubric reveals systemic issues in accessibility testing, performance monitoring, and educational domain modeling.

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Accessibility-First**: Infrastructure components must support classroom accessibility
2. **Performance Standards**: Integration tests must meet <500ms threshold
3. **Educational Context**: Tests must reflect real teacher/pupil scenarios
4. **Architectural Reliability**: Provider patterns must be robust and testable

**Impact on Oak's Mission:**
- Infrastructure reliability directly affects classroom experiences
- Accessibility failures prevent inclusive education
- Performance issues impact teacher workflow efficiency
- Poor domain modeling misses educational edge cases

The infrastructure tests improvement plan requires immediate action to ensure Oak's technical foundation supports its educational mission effectively.
