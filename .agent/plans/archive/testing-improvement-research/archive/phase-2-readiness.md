# Phase 2 Readiness Summary

**Date**: July 9, 2025  
**Status**: Ready to begin Phase 2 (Planning)  
**Foundation**: Phase 1.2 identification complete

## What We Know (Phase 1 Complete)

### Test Landscape

- **641 test files** across the codebase
- **Quality Score**: 6.2/10 (context-aware)
- **Component Tests**: 5.2/10 (biggest opportunity)
- **Utility Tests**: 7.8/10 (good patterns to replicate)

### Critical Gaps Identified

1. **22 custom hooks** with zero tests
2. **Business logic** mixed with UI in components
3. **Implementation testing** instead of behavior testing
4. **No accessibility testing** framework

### Quick Wins Available

1. **10+ pure functions** ready for extraction
2. **Mock factory patterns** documented
3. **API test quality** improvements (100% coverage exists)
4. **Top 20 components** identified for refactoring

## Phase 2 Planning Priorities

### 1. Pure Function Extractions (Highest ROI)

- Quiz validation and scoring
- Video progress calculations  
- School data validation
- Resource formatting
- Error message generation

### 2. Critical Hook Testing

- useShareExperiment (179 lines)
- useTeacherNotes (164 lines)
- useCurriculumDownloads (141 lines)
- useCurrentSection (145 lines)

### 3. Component Refactoring

- Break down SubjectPhasePicker (1,468 lines)
- Refactor Flex.deprecated (61 imports)
- Improve ButtonAsLink behavior tests

### 4. Architecture Improvements

- Implement service layer for business logic
- Add error boundaries per feature
- Standardize data fetching patterns

## Resources Created

### Templates and Patterns

- Mock factory patterns guide
- Test type examples with Oak code
- Performance testing patterns
- Accessibility testing examples

### Analysis Documents

- Component anti-patterns catalog
- React best practices for testing
- Next.js testing improvements
- Test organization recommendations

### Concrete Plans

- Curriculum downloads refactoring strategy
- High-traffic component test plans
- Custom hook testing priorities

## Success Criteria for Phase 2

### Planning Deliverables

1. Sprint-sized work packages
2. Owner assignments for each improvement
3. Code review checklists
4. Team training materials

### Technical Specifications

1. Pure function extraction guides
2. Component refactoring patterns
3. Hook testing strategies
4. Performance benchmarks

### Process Improvements

1. TDD adoption plan
2. Accessibility-first development
3. Continuous quality metrics

## Recommended Phase 2 Structure

### Week 1: Planning Sprint

- Review all Phase 1.2 findings with team
- Prioritize improvements by impact/effort
- Create implementation roadmap
- Assign pilot projects

### Week 2: Pilot Projects

- Extract 3 pure functions with tests
- Refactor 1 high-traffic component
- Test 1 critical hook
- Measure improvements

### Week 3: Scale Planning

- Document lessons learned
- Create automation tools
- Plan team training
- Set quality gates

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Breaking changes**: Use incremental extraction
- **Performance regression**: Add benchmarks first
- **Test brittleness**: Focus on behavior, not implementation

### Team Risks

- **Resistance to change**: Start with volunteers
- **Knowledge gaps**: Provide training and pairing
- **Time pressure**: Focus on highest ROI items

## Conclusion

Phase 1.2 has provided a comprehensive foundation for improvement:

- Clear understanding of current state
- Prioritized list of improvements
- Concrete patterns and examples
- Measurable success criteria

The team is ready to move into Phase 2 (Planning) with confidence. The focus should be on creating actionable, sprint-sized improvements that deliver value quickly while building toward the long-term goal of 8.5/10 test quality.
