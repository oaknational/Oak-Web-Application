| **QW-007**: Test Utilities | Over-abstraction | Medium | Low | - Start with minimal utilities<br>- Get team feedback early<br>- Document usage clearly | - Inline utilities if unused<br>- Simplify abstractions<br>- Gradual adoption |
| **QW-009**: ButtonAsLink Tests | Breaking existing tests | Low | Medium | - Run full test suite first<br>- Keep original test structure<br>- Add new tests alongside | - Revert test changes<br>- Fix one test at a time<br>- Document learnings |
| **SI-001**: Mock Factories | Over-engineering | Medium | Low | - Start with 3-5 objects only<br>- Simple factory pattern first<br>- Iterate based on usage | - Simplify factory structure<br>- Use only where beneficial<br>- Fall back to inline mocks |
| **SI-002**: useShareExperiment Tests | Complex state interactions | High | Medium | - Map all state transitions first<br>- Test incrementally<br>- Mock external dependencies carefully | - Partial test coverage OK<br>- Focus on critical paths<br>- Pair programming session |
| **SI-003**: useTeacherNotes Tests | Optimistic update issues | Medium | Medium | - Test rollback scenarios<br>- Verify data consistency<br>- Check error boundaries | - Accept partial coverage<br>- Document known issues<br>- Plan follow-up work |

## Risk Categories

### 1. Technical Risks

**Breaking Changes**
- **Risk**: Extracted functions behave differently than original
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Extensive testing before and after
  - Feature flags for gradual rollout
  - Side-by-side comparison of outputs
  - Preserve exact logic including edge cases

**Performance Degradation**
- **Risk**: Extracted functions slower than inline code
- **Mitigation**:
  - Benchmark before and after
  - Keep functions simple and focused
  - Avoid unnecessary abstractions
  - Profile in production-like environment

### 2. Process Risks

**Scope Creep**
- **Risk**: Quick wins become complex refactors
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strict scope boundaries in guides
  - Time-box each implementation
  - "Good enough" mindset
  - Save improvements for later phases

**Knowledge Transfer**
- **Risk**: Patterns not understood or followed
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clear documentation with examples
  - Review first implementations together
  - Create template repositories
  - Regular check-ins during Phase 3

### 3. Business Risks

**User Impact**
- **Risk**: Changes affect user experience
- **Mitigation**:
  - No visual changes in quick wins
  - Test critical user journeys
  - Monitor error rates post-deployment
  - Quick rollback procedures

**Productivity Impact**
- **Risk**: New patterns slow down development
- **Mitigation**:
  - Optional adoption initially
  - Prove value with metrics
  - Provide clear migration guides
  - Support during transition

## Severity Levels

### High Impact Risks
These require immediate attention and careful handling:
- Quiz scoring (QW-001) - affects student assessments
- School validation (QW-003) - blocks teacher onboarding
- Share experiment (SI-002) - complex collaborative feature

### Medium Impact Risks
These need monitoring but are manageable:
- Video progress (QW-002) - visible but not critical
- Button tests (QW-009) - affects test suite
- Teacher notes (SI-003) - important but contained

### Low Impact Risks
These are learning opportunities:
- Resource formatting (QW-004) - cosmetic only
- Performance benchmarks (QW-006) - development only
- Test utilities (QW-007) - optional adoption

## General Mitigation Strategies

### Before Implementation
1. **Read implementation guide thoroughly**
2. **Check existing test coverage**
3. **Understand current behavior completely**
4. **Set up rollback plan**

### During Implementation
1. **Follow guide step-by-step**
2. **Test continuously**
3. **Commit incrementally**
4. **Document surprises**

### After Implementation
1. **Run full test suite**
2. **Manual testing of affected flows**
3. **Monitor error tracking**
4. **Gather feedback**

## Emergency Procedures

### If Something Breaks

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   ```bash
   # Revert the specific commit
   git revert <commit-hash>
   
   # Or reset to before changes
   git reset --hard <previous-commit>
   ```

2. **Communication**:
   - Alert team immediately
   - Document what broke
   - Create incident report

3. **Recovery**:
   - Fix forward if simple
   - Full rollback if complex
   - Add missing tests

### Escalation Path

1. **Level 1**: Try mitigation strategy
2. **Level 2**: Implement contingency plan
3. **Level 3**: Full rollback and reassess
4. **Level 4**: Skip quick win, document learnings

## Success Indicators

Track these to ensure risks are managed:
- ✅ No production incidents from quick wins
- ✅ All quick wins have rollback tested
- ✅ Error rates remain stable
- ✅ Performance metrics unchanged
- ✅ Team confidence growing
- ✅ Patterns being adopted

## Risk Review Schedule

- **Daily**: Check error tracking during implementation
- **Per Quick Win**: Review specific risks before starting
- **Weekly**: Team sync on risk status
- **Phase End**: Full risk retrospective

## Conclusion

Most quick wins are low risk with proper preparation. The key is:
1. Understand current behavior completely
2. Test thoroughly at each step
3. Have rollback plans ready
4. Communicate openly about issues
5. Learn from each implementation

The guides include specific risk mitigations. Follow them carefully and these risks become manageable learning opportunities rather than problems.
