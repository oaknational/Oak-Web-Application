# Phase 2.2 Plan: Architecture Planning

**Phase**: 2.2 - Architecture Planning  
**Status**: READY TO START  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 2.1 Complete (Quick Win Planning done)  
**Outcome**: Architectural patterns and strategies for sustainable test improvements

**Important**: Phase 2 is entirely about planning. No production code changes will be made. All work products are planning documents and architectural decisions.

## Purpose

Design architectural patterns that support testable code, based on learnings from Phase 2.1 quick wins. Focus on sustainable patterns that the team can adopt incrementally.

## Objectives

1. **Service Layer Design**: Define patterns for extracting business logic
2. **Component Architecture**: Create decomposition strategies for large components
3. **Error Handling**: Standardize error boundary patterns
4. **Data Fetching**: Establish consistent patterns for data management

## Deliverables

### 1. Service Layer Architecture Document

**What**: Patterns for separating business logic from UI components

**Contents**:
- Service layer principles for Oak's domain
- Migration strategy from mixed concerns
- TypeScript interface patterns
- Testing strategy for services
- Examples using Phase 2.1 extractions

**Based on Phase 2.1 learnings**:
- Quiz validation service pattern
- Video analytics service pattern
- School data service pattern

### 2. Component Decomposition Guide

**What**: Strategies for breaking down large components

**Target Components** (from Phase 1.2 analysis):
- SubjectPhasePicker (1,468 lines)
- Flex.deprecated (61 imports)
- Large form components

**Guide Contents**:
- Decomposition principles
- State management patterns
- Props drilling vs context
- Performance considerations
- Migration approach

### 3. Error Boundary Implementation Plan

**What**: Comprehensive error handling strategy

**Requirements**:
- User-friendly error messages
- Error tracking integration
- Fallback UI patterns
- Recovery mechanisms
- Testing approaches

### 4. Data Fetching Pattern Library

**What**: Standardized approaches to data management

**Patterns to Define**:
- Server-side data fetching (Next.js patterns)
- Client-side data fetching (SWR/React Query)
- Caching strategies
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Optimistic updates

## Process

### Week 1: Research and Analysis

**Days 1-2**: Review current architecture
- Analyze existing service patterns
- Document current component structures
- Identify architectural debt

**Days 3-4**: Design service layer
- Define service boundaries
- Create interface patterns
- Document migration path

**Day 5**: Component decomposition research
- Analyze large components
- Identify common patterns
- Create decomposition templates

### Week 2: Documentation and Review

**Days 1-2**: Create architectural guides
- Service layer documentation
- Component patterns guide
- Error handling strategies

**Days 3-4**: Team review and feedback
- Present patterns to team
- Gather feedback
- Refine based on input

**Day 5**: Finalize Phase 2.2 deliverables
- Complete all documentation
- Create implementation checklists
- Prepare for Phase 2.3

## Success Criteria

Phase 2.2 is complete when:

1. ✅ Service layer patterns documented with examples
2. ✅ Component decomposition guide created
3. ✅ Error boundary patterns defined
4. ✅ Data fetching patterns standardized
5. ✅ Team consensus on architectural direction

## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies
- Phase 2.1 completion (implementation guides)
- Team availability for reviews
- Access to current architecture documentation

### Risks
- **Over-engineering**: Keep patterns simple and pragmatic
- **Team buy-in**: Ensure patterns fit team's workflow
- **Migration complexity**: Design incremental adoption path

## Integration with Phase 2.1 Learnings

Use the quick wins from Phase 2.1 as examples:

1. **Quiz Validation** → Service layer example
2. **Video Progress** → Pure function patterns
3. **Mock Factories** → Testing architecture
4. **Component Refactoring** → Decomposition patterns

## Next Steps

Upon completion of Phase 2.2:

1. Proceed to Phase 2.3 (Team Enablement Planning)
2. Prepare architectural examples for Phase 3
3. Update documentation with architectural decisions

**Remember**: Focus on patterns that enable better testing, not just architectural purity. Every pattern should make testing easier and more natural.
