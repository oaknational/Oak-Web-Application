## Knowledge Building Strategy

### Pattern Recognition
Each quick win builds on previous patterns:
```
QW-001 → QW-002 → QW-003 (Pure Function Extraction)
   ↓
SI-001 → QW-007 (Test Infrastructure)
   ↓
SI-002 → SI-003 (Complex Testing)
   ↓
QW-009 (Quality Improvement)
```

| SI-001 | Pair on API design | Architecture decisions |
| SI-002 | Pair on test structure | Complex state handling |
| QW-009 | Pair on refactoring | Best practices demo |

## Knowledge Validation

### After Each Quick Win
1. **Self-Check Questions**:
   - Can I identify similar patterns elsewhere?
   - Could I do this without the guide?
   - What would I do differently?
   - What confused me?

2. **Mini-Retrospective**:
   - What worked well?
   - What was challenging?
   - What patterns emerged?
   - What questions remain?

### After Each Stage
1. **Pattern Review**:
   - Document variations discovered
   - Update templates with learnings
   - Share insights with team
   - Plan improvements

2. **Skill Assessment**:
   - Rate confidence level (1-5)
   - Identify growth areas
   - Plan additional practice
   - Update learning resources

## Common Learning Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Rushing Through Guides
- **Issue**: Missing important details
- **Solution**: Read completely first, then execute
- **Checkpoint**: Summarize before starting

### Pitfall 2: Over-Engineering Early
- **Issue**: Making simple things complex
- **Solution**: Follow guide exactly first time
- **Checkpoint**: Review against guide

### Pitfall 3: Skipping Documentation
- **Issue**: Knowledge not transferred
- **Solution**: Document while doing
- **Checkpoint**: Would someone else understand?

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Failures
- **Issue**: Missing learning opportunities
- **Solution**: Analyze every error
- **Checkpoint**: What did I learn?
