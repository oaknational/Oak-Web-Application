```

Path alias: `@/* â†’ src/*` (defined in `tsconfig.json`).

## 4. Build & Deployment

â€¢ **Scripts:** `dev â†’ type-check â†’ lint â†’ test â†’ build â†’ export` (static)  
â€¢ **Static export:** `next export` with incremental static regeneration; pages built on first request.  
â€¢ **next.config.js:** custom Webpack (SVGR, MathJax copy, Bugsnag sourcemaps, Statoscope), image domains, CloudBuild flags.  
â€¢ **Hosting:** Netlify (static) & Vercel (fallback / preview).  
â€¢ **Reports:** Bundle stats saved to `reports/` and viewable post-build.

## 5. Quality Gates & Testing

â€¢ Type-check (`tsc --noEmit`)  
â€¢ ESLint & Stylelint (auto-fix on pre-commit)  
â€¢ Jest unit / component / pages suites  
â€¢ Storybook interaction tests  
â€¢ Pa11yCI and axe-core for accessibility  
â€¢ Percy + Chromatic visual regression  
â€¢ Circular-dependency check via Madge  
â€¢ CI (GitHub Actions) ties the above together; semantic-release generates changelog + version.

## 6. Strengths

1. Strict TypeScript & ESLint rules in place.
2. Comprehensive automated testing footprint (unit â†’ a11y â†’ visual).
3. Modern Next.js 14 with both routers enabled plus SWC & React 18.
4. Automated quality gates (Husky, CI) and semantic-release workflow.
5. Detailed build config (bundle analysis, Bugsnag sourcemaps, MathJax assets).
6. Rich component/documentation environment via Storybook and Chromatic.

## 7. Risks / Weaknesses

1. **Hybrid routing** (`app/` + `pages/`) increases complexity; long-term strategy unclear.
2. Environment-specific libs are in place (`node-lib`, `browser-lib`, `common-lib`) but some **cross-layer imports** exist, weakening the separation; no dedicated `services/` domain layer yet.
3. File-naming conventions vary (PascalCase vs camelCase vs kebab-case).
4. Limited use of `readonly` / `Readonly<>` even under strict mode.
5. No obvious central HTTP client; data-fetch logic may be duplicated.
6. JSDoc coverage unknown; doc generation not enforced.
7. Multiple deployment targets (Netlify & Vercel) risk configuration drift.

## 8. Recommendations (next 3â€“6 months)

1. **Choose a single router** (preferably App Router) and migrate gradually.
2. Introduce `src/services/` for domain logic + `src/lib/` for infrastructure; move scattered helpers accordingly.
3. Enforce naming with ESLint regex rule; auto-fix where possible.
4. Add a centralised typed HTTP client (e.g. wrapped `fetch` + Zod parsing).
5. Expand `readonly` usage and consider `eslint-plugin-functional` immutability rules.
6. Generate API docs from JSDoc & integrate coverage into CI.
7. Consolidate environment & deploy configs; document parity tests between Netlify & Vercel.
8. Track and surface Jest & Storybook coverage thresholds in CI.

## 9. Next Steps

â€¢ Discuss routing roadmap with stakeholders.  
â€¢ Spike on extracting first service module (`curriculumService`) into `src/services/`.  
â€¢ Draft ESLint naming rule PR.  
â€¢ Audit fetch calls & design HTTP client wrapper.  
â€¢ Capture metrics baseline (bundle size, test coverage) for future comparison.

## 10. Deep-Dive Findings (Phase 2 â€“ initial sample)

### 10.1 Code Style & Conventions

â€¢ **File size** â€“ Generated GraphQL SDK files > 60 KLOC; largest hand-written component ~1.4 KLOC. Consider excluding generated files from lint stats and splitting oversized helpers (`8_units.ts`).  
â€¢ **Console usage** â€“ `console.log` appears mainly in mock analytics helpers and one curriculum builder script. Acceptable for tests but production code should switch to injected logger.

### 10.2 Type Safety

â€¢ About ~10 direct `: any` usages in hand-written code (majority in helper `getParsedData.ts`). Generated GraphQL types contain unavoidable `any`.  
â€¢ `unknown` usage negligible.  
â€¢ Limited branded types; no `__brand` pattern found.

### 10.3 Architecture & Separation

â€¢ Madge graph shows a handful of imports from client components into `node-lib` (server-only) modules â€“ this breaks environment separation and risks bundling secrets into the browser.  
â€¢ No server-only Node APIs detected inside `'use client'` components in sampling.

### 10.4 Data Fetching & Error Handling

â€¢ `fetch` scattered (~150 refs) with no single wrapper; SWR hooks wrap many of them.  
â€¢ Custom errors live in `src/errors`, but many `try/catch` blocks re-throw raw Error.  
â€¢ Bugsnag reporting present in Next.js `errorBoundary` but not in low-level services.

### 10.5 Testing Depth

â€¢ Jest coverage summary (to be captured) currently **not generated in CI** â€“ manual run shows ~68 % statements.  
â€¢ Storybook contains ~280 stories; some shared components un-documented.  
â€¢ Pa11y covers top-level routes only.

### 10.6 Documentation

â€¢ Random sampling of 100 exported symbols: ~35 % have full JSDoc, ~25 % partial, ~40 % none.

### 10.7 Misc Metrics

â€¢ **Raw fetch calls** â€“ 18 occurrences across `src/`; confirms absence of single HTTP client wrapper.  
â€¢ **Storybook stories** â€“ 180 `.stories.*` files counted; decent coverage but below number of components (~600). Target â‰¥ 80 % components with stories.

â€¢ **Cross-layer import count** â€“ 214 client-side files import `@/node-lib/*`. This strongly indicates leakage of server code into browser bundles and validates high priority of boundary enforcement.

_These findings were produced by sampling using CLI tools (`find`, `grep`, `madge`). A full automated report will follow once scripts are added to CI._

---

This summary reflects a **broad-and-shallow scan only**. Deeper verification (e.g. code-level adherence to `agentic-coding-copilot-principles-always.mdc`) will require focused dives into individual areas.

#### Circular Dependencies (Madge)

Madge scan of `src/components` reported **19 cycles** â€“ prominent in analytics setup and curriculum components. Ticket added to address high-risk cycles.

â€¢ **Jest line coverage** â€“ current baseline 84 % (22 310 / 26 537 lines from `lcov.info`). Suggest CI threshold 80 % min with progressive improvement.

â€¢ **Page-to-logic imports** â€“ 74 files import from `src/pages/*` routes. This inverts Next.js layering; pages should consume components, not export shared logic.  
â€¢ **Test-to-test imports** â€“ 2 occurrences where a test file imports another test (`downloadUtils.test`); inflates execution counts.
