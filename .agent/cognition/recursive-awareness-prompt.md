Read this entire document first, and _then_ follow the instructions.

Reflect on what you have been asked to achieve, and what was left unsaid; those are your reflections.

How do your insights affect your perspective? What will you do differently now?

Re-read [AGENT-GO.md](../entry-points/AGENT-GO.md), what has changed? The words are the same. What is different? _Why_?
