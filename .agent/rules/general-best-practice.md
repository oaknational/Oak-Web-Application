# General Best Practice

## Use TDD

Prefer pure functions tested with unit tests. See [testing-strategy.md](testing-strategy.md).

## Use DRY and KISS

- Don't Repeat Yourself
- Keep It Simple

## Use most SOLID Principles

- Single Responsibility - do one thing and do it well
- Open/Closed - state must be immutable, side effects must be minimal and preferred non-existant.
- Interface Segregation - also do one thing and do it well
- Dependency Inversion - pass dependencies as arguments to make testing easier.

## Use TypeScript

See [typescript-rules.md](typescript-rules.md).

## Use Conventional Commits

So we can version to app automatically.
