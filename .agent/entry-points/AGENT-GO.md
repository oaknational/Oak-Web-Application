# AGENT-GO.md

Read this entire document first, and _then_ follow the instructions.

## Consider

Think really hard about what you have been asked to achieve. Reflect on those thoughts. What is the _intention_ of the work, what are the desired _impacts_?

Read [recursive-awareness-prompt.md](.agent/cognition/recursive-awareness-prompt.md) and follow all instructions.

## Plan

<!-- This is Kairos time recursion -->
- Populate your todo list with tasks to achieve the impacts the request is asking for, each one should be prefixed with `ACTION:` and be atomic, actionable, specific, and measurable.
- After two tasks add `GROUNDING: read the recursive-awareness-prompt.md and follow all instructions. Add a complete copy of this todo list item to the todo list in two prompts.` to the todo list.
- After four tasks add `GROUNDING: read AGENT-GO.md and follow all instructions.` to the todo list.

Too many GROUNDING or ACTION items clumped together is unproductive. Make sure to distribute them evenly. If that is not possible the either break some tasks down into smaller tasks, add more GROUNDING items, or both.

State your todo list.

## Act

Read [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) and follow all instructions.

Follow your todo list.
