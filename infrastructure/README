# Infrastructure

This folder current manages the buckets responsible for holding uploaded lesson videos.

The terraform project is broken out into multiple workspaces

- production
- staging
- demo

Each workspace will have variables configured in TF cloud

```
project       = "oak-national-academy"
region        = "europe-west2"
retool_origin = "https://creator-staging.thenational.academy"
environment   = "staging"

```

## Local setup
