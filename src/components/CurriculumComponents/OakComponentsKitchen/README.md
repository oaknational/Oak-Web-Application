# curriculum/OakComponentsKitchen
Components live here which will hopefully end up in https://github.com/oaknational/oak-components

These are controlled by the curriculum team, but aren't quite ready yet. Other teams are free to use them as they shouldn't have anything curriculum specific.

Notes

 - If you change the API get a curriculum sqaud engineer to approve the change in the PR
 - You are actively encouraged to suggest changes to the components API
 - The more teams that use these the better
