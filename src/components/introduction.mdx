# Oak Storybook

Welcome to Oak's Storybook. Browse our component examples and usage guidelines. This is being updated to reflect our [new Oak component structure](https://components.thenational.academy).


## Folder structure:
- AppComponents
- CurriculumComponents
- GenericPagesComponents
- GenericPagesViews
- PupilComponents
- PupilViews
- SharedComponents
- TeacherComponents
- TeacherViews


## Rules

- **AppComponents** 
    - app related components such as header, footer, menu, layout, etc.
- **CurriculumComponents**
    - curriculum related components (components used in `/teachers/curriculum/` belong here rather than in `TeacherComponents`)
- **GenericPagesComponents**
    - components related to generic pages, such as Contact or About us
- **GenericPagesViews**
    - views related to generic pages, such as Contact or About us
- **PupilComponents**
    - components related to pupil journey
- **PupilViews**
    - views related to pupil journey
- **SharedComponents**
    - components imported by components from multiple folders or another component in `SharedComponents`
    - this folder will be replaced by `oak-components` and deprecated one day
- **TeacherComponents**
    - components related to teacher journey
- **TeacherViews**
    - views related to teacher journey


**Renaming:**

- Anything prefaced with Oak is now prefaced with OWA
    - NB. OakComponents from the external library will not be changed
    - NB. Pupil components use OakComponents so no changes should happen here
- If something is used only by one component/related to one page, prefix it accordingly
    - for example `ButtonLinkNav` becomes `AboutUsNavButton` if it is only used on About us page
    - if you reuse the component in another place, update the naming accordignly/move to relevant folder (for example if you reuse `AboutUsNavButton` in one of the `TeacherComponents` you should move it to `SharedComponents` and rename to `NavButton`)

**Views:**

- Anything with suffix `.page` goes into a relevant view folder and changes suffix to `.view`

**Outcome:**

- No nesting beyond two levels (extracting all nested components)
- The above rule about nesting is currently implemented in all components except `ShharedComponents` as those will be deprecated one day and we didn't want to spend time on improving them
