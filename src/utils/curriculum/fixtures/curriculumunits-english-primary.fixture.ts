        "This unit builds on the conversational skills covered in Year 2 by developing pupils' oral narrative techniques, focusing on structured storytelling, precise language selection and expressive communication. Pupils refine their ability to sequence events, use descriptive vocabulary, and communicate with confidence. They also develop using varied tone, character voices, facial expressions and body language to engage and captivate their audience.This focus on expressive storytelling prepares pupils for analysing and applying public speaking techniques in the next unit.",

        "In this unit, pupils retell the fairy tale 'Goldilocks and the Three Bears', learning to sequence events and use precise, descriptive vocabulary to enhance their storytelling. They practise techniques to tell the story with charisma, culminating in an expressive retelling to an audience.",
