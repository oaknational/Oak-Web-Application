In that unit, pupils started to notice and comment on writers' structural choices. In this unit, pupils become more conscious of structure, and start to make more complex observations about how writers use structure to manipulate readers. They start to use structure purposefully in their own writing for effect. This prepares them for the unit 'Science fiction writing', where they develop their literary analysis to focus on writers' language choices and their impact. ",
