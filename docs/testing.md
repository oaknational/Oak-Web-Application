# Testing

Note, this document is about automated tests and checks. Manual testing is beyond the scope of this document, and somewhat exists outside of the lifecycle of this code base. We regard the human evaluation of the subjective experience of our apps as vital, as well as appreciating the irreplaceable value of human exploratory testing.

All of our automation, including automated checks, are events driven. Diagram 1. shows the current key events.

## Linting and Style Checks

- Prettier
- ESlint
- Stylelint

## Code Checks

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), with the [NextJS Jest Config](../jest.config.js).

- `npm run test` will run the tests using `--watch`
- `npm run test:ci` will run the tests once and create a coverage report.

Unit tests only for now. Please write any tests dependent on a network connection, a database, filesystem or any other IO. They all run for each commit and we need to keep that fast.

### When They Run

- Manually with `npm run test`.
- On pre-commit.
- On push in a Github workflow.

### Location

Tests live next to the code they are testing wherever possible. Next does not allow any files under the `src/pages/` directory other than routes, so those test file are under the `src/__tests_/pages/` directory, mirroring the `src/pages` file structure.

Logic tests and snapshot tests should be in different files because their "failure" state has a different meaning. Snapshot tests should live next to the component they are testing, and have a name following the pattern `<component_name>.snapshot.test.tsx`. Note that we are hoping to have Storybook generate snapshots for all tests automatically, so these files be removed in future.

## E2E Browser Tests

We use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

### When They Run

- Manually against local Playwright binaries with `npm run playwright:test`. If you have no already downloaded the binaries you will need to run `npm run playwright:install` first.
- Manually, locally, against Browserstack `npm run playwright:test:bs_local`. You will need `BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY` in your `.env` file. You can get those values from Browserstack by logging in.
- On push in a Github workflow, against Browserstack.

### Location

The current tests live [here](../e2e_tests/browser/engineering/). The naming is intended to leave room for creating some product-facing tests using feature files, this is subject to change.

## Storybook

- Automated snapshot tests
- Automated component a11y tests.

## Percy

Visual regression testing of deployed apps.

### When They Run

In a Github workflow triggered by a `deployment_status === success` event.

## Pa11y

Accessibility testing of deployed apps.

### When They Run

In a Github workflow triggered by a `deployment_status === success` event.
