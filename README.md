# Samara

A really good remote education app.

## Getting started

First, run:

```bash
cp .env.test .env.development.local
```

and fill in the values by asking another member of the team.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Automatic Checks

For more detail please see the [test documentation](docs/testing.md).

### Unit tests

Unit tests live next to the code they are testing wherever possible. Next does not allow any files under the `src/pages/` directory other than routes, so those test file are under the `src/__tests_/pages/` directory, mirroring the `src/pages` file structure.

- `npm run test` will run the tests using `--watch`
- `npm run test:ci` will run the tests once and create a coverage report.

### End-to-End Browser Tests

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) tests live [here](e2e_tests/browser), and can be run locally against Playwright binaries, locally against Browserstack, or in CI against Browserstack.

See the [testing docs for further details](./docs/testing.md#e2e-browser-tests).

### Pre-commit and Commit Message Hooks

We use [Husky to run pre-commit and commit message validating hooks](.husky), including unit tests, code linting, type checking, and commit message format checking.

### Pre-commit

Currently this hook

- Formats the code using Prettier
- Runs the linting
- Runs the unit tests

### Commit Message Validation

We use [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) to validate that commit message meet the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) standard. If you want help with the format you can use the interactive commit message prompt by running the script `npm run cc`, note you will need to have staged Git changes first or it will error (because there will be nothing to commit).

## CI/CD

### Pull Requests and Automated Checks

#### Required Github Secrets for Workflows

**TO DO**

- `A_SECRET_VALUE` - Some config or tool auth.

### Builds and Deployments

- Preview builds on Vercel
- Production builds on Vercel

#### Required Environment Variables for Builds

**TO DO**

- `SOMETHING_TO_DO_WITH_HASURA` - So secret.

### Release Mechanism

- All changes to the `main` branch must happen through pull requests.
- Changes on the `main` branch trigger the `create_semantic_release` Github workflow which creates a Github release, and updates the package.json version number. The commit message has a structure set in [`release.config.js`](release.config.js).
- All commits on `main` will trigger a Vercel deploy, but non-release commits ([according to the commit message structure](scripts/build/cancel_vercel_build.js)), will be cancelled.
- The Vercel deployment will trigger the `deployment_checks` Github workflow.

## Npm dependencies

  - React library for Bugsnag

- @hookform/resolvers

  - Validation resolvers for react-hook-form (allows us to use zod schema for validation)
