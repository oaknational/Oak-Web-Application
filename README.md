A really good remote education app.

## Getting started

First, run:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

and fill in the incomplete values by asking another member of the team.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

Unit tests only for now, please no note write any tests dependent on a network connection, a database, a filesystem or any other IO.

Tests live next to the code they are testing wherever possible. Next does not allow any files under the `src/pages/` directory other than routes, so those test file are under the `src/__tests_/pages/` directory, mirroring the `src/pages` file structure.

- `npm run test` will run the tests using `--watch`
- `npm run test:ci` will run the tests once and create a coverage report.

## Pre-commit and Commit Message Hooks

We use [Husky to run pre-commit and commit message validating hooks](.husky).

### Pre-commit

Currently this hook

- Formats the code using Prettier
- Runs the linting
- Runs the unit tests

### Commit Message Validation

We use [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) to validate that commit message meet the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) standard. If you want help with the format you can use the interactive commit message prompt by running the script `npm run cc`, note you will need to have staged Git changes first or it will error (because there will be nothing to commit).

## Release Mechanism

- All changes to the `main` branch must happen through pull requests.
- Changes on the `main` branch trigger the `create_semantic_release` Github workflow which creates a Github release, and updates the package.json version number. The commit message has a structure set in [`release.config.js`](release.config.js).
- All commits on `main` will trigger a Vercel deploy, but non-release commits ([according to the commit message structure](scripts/build/cancel_vercel_build.js)), will be cancelled.
- The Vercel deployment will trigger the `deployment_checks` Github workflow.
